## Extra questions

We'd love to hear your thoughts on some of these questions. Please don't spend more than a minute or two on each question.

## What are some edge cases you would take care of before shipping this to production?

- - Write unit and integration tests
- - Document APIs using swagger
- - Secure APIs using JWT
- - Improve the search by making it case insensitive
- - Add pagination
- - Use better monitoring and logging to spot errors

## How would you scale this to handle high amounts of traffic?

- - Optimise database queries
- - Implement rate limiting
- - Use a NoSQL database like MongoDB for faster queries. It can be scaled horizontally as well.
